# Scope &amp; Purpose of Math Invaders

Online games are no longer used only as a form of entertainment but can also be used for educational purposes as done on our creation. The name of our game is: &quot;Math Invaders&quot; which is exactly what the name means. The game is created to educate children of a younger demographic about the importance of basic maths (mainly addition) to give them an area to improve on. Addition in the foundation of maths and is one of the most basic equations in the area. Using this along with the most trending game genre does wonders and give the users an additional entertainment while learning at the same time. Children by nature love games and mixing it with learning can prove to be a useful fusion. The game is designed to help children with addition. It is done by having the game show a question such as &quot;2 + 4 =?&quot; and the player would have to shoot the correct target that contains the answer. There are two ways for the player to gain points on the score: Shooting the correct math value of the question which gives 50 points and shooting an incorrect one which gives only 10 points.

Our game has a unique element which has worked great for children: competitiveness. During the planning phase of the game, we assumed the best option for making the audience have a reason to continue playing is the form of competitiveness which gives them a reason to stay. There was a study which has shown that competitive games can promote prosocial behaviour and develop skill which would prove to be useful when having an educational aspect integrated. Having done that, the Educational Math Shooter has delivered on that with its scoring feature were the game would show a person&#39;s score and have them enthusiastic enough to defeat each other&#39;s highest scores. The game has fulfilled this action impressively by having a difficulty level as time passes on and becomes harder to dodge the incoming targets. To counter this difficulty is to aim for the correct math values which give the player a higher score of 50 points to quickly gain an advantage in the beginning before it becomes too over-whelming for the player. It is still possible to escape the incoming targets but as time passes on, it becomes harder and not able to keep up with the questions.

## 2.1 - Learning Outcomes

The Math Invaders game will provide questions for those who struggle with simple addition. The game provides random mathematical equations that need to be solved quickly before the player&#39;s rocket is destroyed. The game will provide multiple objectives for the players to have a successful learning outcome in the subject. These outcomes would include:

- An outcome that would be achieved by the player is to add one-digit or two-digit numbers up to 10 including 0.
- Read &amp; analyse numbers from 1 to 10 in numerals
- Represent the use of number bonds that are related to addition
- Solving math equations at a fast pace

# Chapter 3 - Persona Analysis

Finding the right target audience for my game was done in the pre-planning phase where we selected which demographic would be most interested and engaged in the planned game. Trying to aim for the correct target audience is important because it helps to understand our audience and allow us to reach those people. When planning the game, we asked ourselves: What is the game aimed at? To find out the answer is to reach out to the largest audience possible and to do that is to find out what demographic plays games the most. The most influential trend of gamers is of the age under 16 years old (PEGI 3) and it continues to grow as years pass. We knew targeting that audience would be the wisest decision, so we pursued it. Hitting the right target audience is an integral part of game creation and to know this requires the knowledge of each demographic that the game is aimed for:

- **Age** : Under 16
- **Location** : Worldwide
- **Gender** : Gender Neutral
- **Income Level** : Requires a low-end PC with an internet connection (Standard level of living)
- **Education level** : Minimum education below Key Stage 3 (KS3)
- **Occupation:** Student
- **Ethnic Background** : Any person of ethnic background

## 3.1 - Behavioural Analysis

Understanding the behaviour of my audience is vital when it comes to publicizing the game to the public. Evaluating why the consumers may not be interested in the game can teach us how to reach them. Conducting a behavioural analysis involves multiple steps to overcome which would help garner a large player base. One of the most important steps is to identify the current target audience segments which would involve characteristics like location, gender and age. Assuming they all require the same thing is folly mistake and can lead to misassumptions and then lead to distancing myself from the targeted audience. Another step which leads to success is to see what is working and what is not. This can guide the game to make some changes and improvements that benefit the audience. The Math Invaders shooter game was tested on a target audience of a 9 year old child before being fully released. It was tested in a beta form that did not contain a score feature. After the test was complete, we asked the child what needed to be done for improvements and he answered with a way to keep score. We considered the option of adding a score tally which would keep track of the points and give it a competitiveness composition. In conclusion, behavioural personas are useful to understand the true concept of a game with the target audience and provide us with the right information to improve the game and publish it once it has improved. The differences of the target audience and the behavioural aspects of a person goes deeper when painting a picture of the audience. The psychographic criteria could include differences such as:

- **Hobbies:** Children who have a hobby for online arcade games similar to space invaders or other 2D platformers.
- **Interests:** Interested in improving their maths capabilities with an entertainment style application
- **Values:** These could include values of dedication, improvement and effort.
- **Attitudes:** Those who have an enjoyable attitude and love to get along with others to compete on the game.
- **Behaviours:** Would include people with any behaviour characteristic
- **Lifestyle preferences:** Those who prefer to surf the web for interesting games on a computer and love to try out new things.

## 3.2 - Why the target audience was chosen

Choosing a younger demographic for an educational game is the right one because of the increasing number of younger children engaging on the internet and playing games. A survey taken by the Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes published a report that revealed children of the age of 5-15 spend over 15 hours a week online which has overtaken watching TV. This is a dramatic change in the demographics as parents are less likely to block their children from surfing the internet. Parents have begun encouraging them to spend more and learn how to program, prepare their assignments online and other educational matters. Having an educational game would fit right in and give the children an entertaining way for them to learn and interact with maths. This data also includes primary school children of the age of 3-4 who spend over eight hours online.

# Chapter 4 - Requirement Specification

When designing a serious game, there has to be requirements that need to be fulfilled, ones that attribute to a traditional serious game and others that captivate the targeted audience. Typically, a requirement specification is used to determine what is required within a software before it is launched. The developed Serious Game requires other components such as a modern computer and Google Chrome&#39;s browser. The game was developed by using HTML5 along with CSS and JavaScript. When launching it, it was intended to remove the necessity of requiring Adobe Flash to run the game which can be a nuisance to install on a browser. The Math Invaders Game does not require a high-end computer but can also include any modern computer with basic components. The game&#39;s system requirements are as follows:

- CPU: Minimum Intel Atom with a Single-Core 1.00 Ghz Processor. (Intel Pentium 4 Processor)
- RAM: 512 DDR1 – 3.00 Ghz
- Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 or later.
- Any video chipset – Integrated or dedicated graphics card.

## 4.1 - Is The Game Fun?

To target a younger audience, you need to captivate them and make them entertained by what was built. Even though the main goal of the serious game is to teach, there is still room for entertainment and enjoyability. The Math Invaders Game has hit this goal by implementing strategy, entertaining functionality and shooting things up. The game is based on the old arcade space invaders concept that was a hit years ago that was also one of the frontrunners of modern video games that was enjoyed by millions of people and famous in the global gaming industry. The serious game follows the same pattern with the scores, basic controls and design. Our game has minor differences to allow it follow the requirements of an educational game but can still be played without one but gives the user a bigger disadvantage thanks to the implementation of differences when shooting the correct math value for 50 points and a regular target for 10 points.

## 4.2 - Is The Game Educational?

A Serious game cannot reach its goal without a learning element being included. Having decided on which type of educational subject to implement, we decided to go with a mathematical one because of its simplicity and no language barrier. So, it can be played across the world and taught the same way. The game is dedicated for those who have issues with maths or are at a younger age and starting to learn maths in their schools. The game&#39;s core is of an educational one, where the user&#39;s mission is to shoot the correct value that is asked in the top corner of the screen. When shooting the wrong answer of the question, the user is rewarded with only 10 points while shooting the correct value would give the user a 5x multiplier and award them with 50 points. Giving the user a larger award would encourage them to answer the questions correctly and as a result, improve their field in maths.

## 4.3 - Previous Game Idea

Before concluding which game idea we would be using, we decided to plan out multiple game concepts that would help entertain different audiences by using numerous genre ideas. One of the main concepts before the decision was a story telling flash game with interactivity. The game would include multiple children books that would function with the story being told in an animated way from top to bottom in text. Books that would have been included were Jack and Jill, Gingerbread man and Goldilocks and the three bears. Having an interactive story telling book would have been an interesting concept but there would have been issues with language barriers and the disadvantages of Adobe Flash were the game would not support many mobile devices. One of the biggest downfalls of the idea was the lack of entertainment and playability. Reading a book can be fun but not for all. This is when we decided to use maths as a subject because of it being taught globally along with using HTML5 as its chosen programming language.

## 4.4 - Non-Functional Requirements

For all the time we spend on creating the game to serve the end user, there should be time invested to assist the backend developers and how well they can create a realistic workflow for all of the team members. Allowing for extensible architecture by continuing to develop the game and fix any bugs that may occur. Non-functional requirements should be used to judge how well the game operates instead of its behaviours when played. Typically, the non-functional requirements would include matters which would have a factor in the performance of the game, the reliability and how well it can be maintained within the system it is being run on. Below will explain the non-functional requirements that were achieved for the game.

### 4.4.1 - Coding Standards

The coding standard for the application should be concise with the standard that is typically used by other web developers and programmers. Having it done like this would allow for easy changes when someone needs to edit the current code. A good option that was added within the Math Invaders was the use of commenting to label what each code is written for and to allow for easy communication with new web editors. The commenting of the code should be labelled as much as possible so the web team can search for what function is needed with ease as done here.

Figure 4 - image of code

The format of the code is also important and how well it is organised. Depending on the programming language, they all have their own way of being written. But with a web game, the coding is also done either in the same file (including HTML, CSS and JS.) together or in their own files. We handled the code differently, we integrated the multiple coding languages together but into their own pages. With a format following its own separate blocks.

### 4.4.2 - Pause and Resume

Almost all action-based games require a pause &amp; resume button. It is a fundamental test for a good gaming architecture. An option for the user to pause the game at any time is incredibly useful especially for the developers would like to test a certain element within a game and having it paused to examine it would be convenient. If the developers are testing a classification that is at the end of the game and they have no option to pause it to make the changes, it would take forever to get it right.

### 4.4.3 - Memory-Leak

Having a zero-memory-leak application is extremely important when it comes to building a compatible and optimized game. If a game is un-optimized, it may affect the computer, primary the ram which is a finite resource with only so much it can handle. Math Invaders is a browser based game and is best run on Google chrome. Let alone, Google chrome has issues with memory usage so having a memory-leaking game which is even more deadly, can slow down the computer immensely. Having the game leak memory could also have an effect on the response time of the game. The average response time of a click and reaction is usually 0.5 seconds while the maximum could reach over 5 seconds. Math invaders has been created with this issue in mind and can be seen how the memory is being used on task manager. The game only takes 35.8MB of the RAM &amp; 2.9% of CPU usage. There has reportedly been no high usage peaks therefore no leak occurrences. Google&#39;s homepage takes a little over with a memory usage of 3.9MB for comparison



# Chapter 5 - Math Invaders Mechanics

Math invaders is a web game that was inspired by the old arcade space invaders game with slight differences. These differences are what makes the game unique and special. The task of the game was to add an educational element into it which has been uniquely done. Instead of the shooter destroying the enemies, they destroy math values that are asked by in the game. Since it was browser based game, the languages that were used where: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript Technology. This technology allows for the three main elements to function which are:

5.1 - Airship

The airship or is known in the game as &#39;Hero&#39; is the main character and what the user controls. The airship is able to move alongside the window from left or right and is able to shoot missiles which would target the enemy. The airship was designed as a rocket which is what it would usually look like in real life but with bright blue colours to stand out from the black background (space). The controls of the spaceship were created using JavaScript and it possible to change the speed of the rocket with ease. The **handleControls()** Method is what handles the keyboard events (left, right and spacebar)



## 5.2 - Enemy

The enemy is the target of what the airship should destroy. The enemy comes in the form of random math values that need to be targeted according to question on the screen. The user is able to shoot the wrong value target but receive a smaller reward of 10 points. The correct value is worth 50 + and is what the airship should be aiming for. The enemy is programmed to come from the top and move to the bottom similar to the original space invaders. The code that handles this expression is the function **updatePositions()** which is shown here in its entirety:

Figure 11- updates the position of the enemy

Adding an enemy to the screen works differently and according to a certain interval. The enemies update their positions over a couple of seconds and the more time the user is playing the most targets appear on the screen. The code handles this by **addEnemy()** which updates the interval after 5 seconds then 15 then 25.

The enemies don&#39;t just show up randomly, but so does the content of the enemy. Each enemy contains a random math value that needs to be targeted for more points. The method that calls this action is **getRandom(interval)** and **getRandom(maxSize)** limits the number amount that shows up. Each of these are coded with the intent to add more interactivity with the user and enable them to brainstorm and shoot the correct value as fast as possible.

Figure 13 - sets the location of the enemy

## 5.3 - Missile/Laser

The Missile or laser is the projectile that gets triggered from the airship when the user presses the Space Bar key. The missile has its own design and functions how a normal missile would – targets the incoming enemy. The missile&#39; div tag is labelled as &#39;laser&#39; which shoots out of the airships graphic. Another feature that was implemented within the code was the rocket&#39;s noise. We have decided to add a sound effect when the rocket is fired to resemble the sound of a real missile attack.

Figure 15 - sets the trajectory of missile

When the rocket is shot, there is an expected collision when it targets an enemy. When the enemy has been destroyed by the rocket or if the rocket has departed the game, the user is then able to shoot again. Adding a limiting function would prevent the player to spam the rockets and win easily – there needs to be a level of difficulty so this was a must.

Figure 16 - the full code of the missile and its settings

## 5.4 - Scoring

The scoring in this game is measured by how many enemies get destroyed by the user. The more enemies that are destroyed, the higher the points the user gains. The scoring function of the game is the main educational element and is designed to teach young people how to calculate additional numbers. The scoring rules associated with the game is done by targeting the correct answer to the math value which displays a random question each time. Shooting the correct value will earn the user a higher amount of points while shooting the incorrect sum will only earn them a lesser score. Each score is summed up and added on to the main equation until the user&#39;s character is destroyed. The expression that handles the scoring feature is done though the **checkCollisions()** function and has an element for each scoring method:

Figure 18 - resolves the value of scores of shooting the correct math question

Scoring the correct math value will earn the user 50 points and can be changed through the red number. Else scoring the incorrect number will only earn the user 10 points:



## 5.5 - Difficulty

The difficulty setting of the game is determined by the time the user is still alive. Instead of implementing levels/difficulty settings that can be clicked on, the difficulty is measured by three Intervals (stages). As time passes on at a certain moment, the difficulty starts to kick in and would result in an increasing amount of enemies that appear onto the screen. The function that handles this is **addEnemy()** which is part of the JavaScript code. The difficulty appears in each iterations:

## 5.6 - Sound

There are six elements of sound that have been implemented onto the game to function as sound effects or background music. Some of the sounds are implemented though JavaScript to be functional when a certain component of the game is triggered. The first sounds that are activated when the game is launched is the main menu music which is looped which is also shared in the instructions page. The music gives the game a more arcade feel and is much more attractive than a silent game.  There other sound effects that were implemented are done in a more complex method. The game requires sounds to initiate when an action has occurred. These actions are needed to give the game a dramatic effect. The actions that have been added which trigger by a user are:

- Shooting the wrong value target activates a sound effect which is similar to balloon popping.
- Shooting the correct math value triggers an applause line which would show that the user has solved the math problem.
- The most effective sound effect is the one which triggers when a user fires the missile and activates missile launch.
- Lastly, the rocket crash sound effect is triggered when the user&#39;s airship is destroyed

An example of the code which triggers the missile sound is done when the user presses the spacebar key:

Figure 21 - shows the audio trigger when missile shot

# Chapter 6 - Interaction Design

Interaction is one of the main agencies that player has to have when playing games. Without the interaction, the game loses its biggest element and no longer functions as something entertaining. There is no such thing as the right amount of interaction because if you have too much, the game would feel chaotic and players wouldn&#39;t feel like they are in control. Additionally, highly interactive mechanics/interaction would feel like the game is dragging on and the player would be wasting too much time. Arcade based games which Math Invaders was based on involved limited amount of interaction which gives the user enough governance to feel like they are in control.

The interaction of the game requires a fun element, especially when dealing with an educational serious game. The purpose of a serious game is to teach but we shouldn&#39;t forget the purpose of a game – to have fun. Interacting with Math Invaders just does that by applying one of the most famous arcade games – space invaders and incorporating an educational side to it. To explain into depth with the interaction part of the game, we will be using the 4 dimensions of interaction design which was created by Gillian Crampton Smith. These interactive methods will go through each aspect of the game and explain them thoroughly.

## 6.1 - Text

Text in serious games need to be meaningful and easy to understand so the players are able to communicate easily when playing, especially with games that are fast-paced and the user needs to be informed quickly to solve the problem. Math Invaders made sure to solve this issue by displaying the text to stand out with the background and made sure it&#39;s visible enough for those who suffer from visual impairment. Math Invaders mostly uses a black background to keep the &#39;spacey&#39; look, so by default, the best colour option for the text is white.

Figure 22 - main menu of game

The buttons that contain a white background must contain black text within them. The language of the text should also be taken into consideration. The target location of the game are for international users and therefore the wisest decision is to use English, as it is a universal language. The terminology of the English language should also be familiar with my young target audience.

## 6.2 - Visual Representations

The concerns that users may face is the lack of visual representations the game might have. Making sure the graphics/images are clear and understandable. Especially for new gamers who may not understand the target of the game or what to do. Math invaders uses realistic and well-known artefacts that are clear to understand.













## 6.3 - Physical Objects &amp; Keys

A game should have tangible ways of control, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t act like one. This section is written for the sole purpose of interactivity and will describe the controls of interactivity the game uses. Math Invaders follows the same pattern the original arcade version uses, which will help familiarise the users in what is on store. The game is best used with a keyboard but can also be programmed to be used on a Windows supported controller. The controls are also labelled in the instruction window or right panel which shows the keys as follows:

Figure 24 - keyboard labelled with bullet points

1. **Spacebar:  ** The spacebar shoots the missile
2. **Left Arrow Key:** Left key moves the airship to the left
3. **Right Arrow Key:** Right key moves the airship to the right

## 6.4 - Time

It is important for a game to have multiple phases which could also be ranked in difficulty. These phases should change the game&#39;s environment and how it reacts to the player&#39;s control. The phases sound very abstract but they are very common and Math Invaders made sure to make use of it. It is done by as time passes on in the game, the difficulty becomes even more severe with multiple more enemies that appear on the game. The game automatically reacts to the player&#39;s interactivity as time passes on. The longer the player stays alive, the multitude of enemies start to swarm and keep the game interesting and enhance the user experience.

Serious Games that involve fast-paced gameplay require a pause and start function which would become useful for the user in case something occurs in their life. Having a way to pause the game and take a bathroom break would become very beneficial. Therefore, adding this function was one of the highest priorities of our game.

## 6.5 - In Summary

Gameplay and visualization are how the target audience respond to the game. The better the design and visualization, the easier the user is able to understand how the game functions. If the user is able to read onto the game without any knowledge beforehand, it has to be clear of what the game contains. An example would be having a &quot;Play Game&quot; button which communicates with the user and let them press that button. Gameplay is the other important factor which involves the entire entertainment and education side. If the gameplay is poorly documented, then the user would be turned off.

# Chapter 7 - User Interface Design of Maths Invader

User interface design focuses on what the users are anticipating and ensures that the interface contains elements that are easy to access, understand and use to facilitate those actions. These could involve components such as navigation which is important when building a user interface design. User interface designs are a good way to immerse the user and make them become involved in what the game is presenting. A way for the user to break the immersion is if the user interface isn&#39;t well-designed or fluid for the user experience (UX). In conclusion, a game hurts itself if it provides too little information/inputs or too many that would confuse the user. To fix this, the user interface needs to have the perfect amount of interaction and quality to keep the player on the game. To explain this further, the game will be evaluated by the way it is visually interpreted and describe why the designs where made to look like that. The evaluation will encompass the three pages of the web game by using numbers and bullet points to indicate which ones are being explained.



## 7.1 - Design Explanation

1. **1)****Main menu Title**: Using white text which is large helps it stand out against the black background. The text is consistent across the game.

1. **2)****Main menu button:** The chosen button has a white background. One of the button is called &quot;play game&quot; which it allows users to start the game, the second button is called &quot;Game instruction&quot; these button are large to help those who suffer from motion disorder.

1. **3)****Main menu background:** The background is a Gif animation which is dark. The background is consistent as it catches the user&#39;s attention.

1. **4)****Enemy:** The enemy represents an explosion which automatically processes the image as the enemy combatant. The colour of this enemy is purple as it stands out.

1. **5)****Missile:** The missile looks similar to the real one in life which would indicate that the user shot the projectile. The drawback of the design is that it is too small and may not be visible for some people.

1. **6)**** Airship:** The design for the airship needed to be visible and colourful to represent the &quot;good guy&quot; character. The colour also helps it visibly stand out from the dark background.

1. **7)****Instruction panel:** The background colour of the panel is grey which allows for the consistent white text to stay visible.

1. **8)****Game Buttons:** The game buttons remain the same throughout the game.

1. **9)****Game background:** The game&#39;s background does not share the main menu&#39;s animated one because of the complexities of the objects being visible but the black theme remains.

1. **10)****Instructions title:** As done with the main menu, the white text stays consistent

1. **11)****Instruction information:** The text of the instructions is designed to be animated and stays within a steady speed to process the information. It stays as white text which regular sized characters.

1. **12)****Instruction&#39;s background:** The animated theme is brought back because it doesn&#39;t bother the elements in the container and stays loyal with the design.

1. **13)****Instruction&#39;s button:** The button which was created in the instruction window still resembles the other buttons with the white background and dark text.

## 7.2 - Consistency

Consistency is key when creating the user interface of a game. Having the game contain elements that are alike on different pages would eliminate learning. How many actions or representations does the player need to remember in order to play the game is a good evaluation of how consist the game should be. Having buttons that are different colours, sizes or placed in different areas would be a problem. Hence, the game follows a platform of conventions to ensure that the elements are designed and positioned in the right places. Math Invaders improved on the consistency of visual elements. Items are kept visually appealing and have a standard across each section of the game. Background design is an example that are maintained without the section and choice of font colour.

## 7.3 - Pre-Planning

It is important to design a rough example of what the final outcome of the design would look like. These are normally done through wireframes or sketches. The wireframes help with visual guidance to represent the framework of the game. These are created for the purpose of arranging elements and designs to best accomplish a particular purpose. For maths invader, we prepared a wireframe which is entirely basic in design to accommodate our plan and then finally sketching the final result because of the flexibility the sketching method has. The main principle that was followed throughout the menus of Maths Invaders was the purpose of making is basic in design and follow a certain dark and galactic theme. The first wireframe design was the main menu which follows a basic premise of having a dark background with lightly coloured text at the top and white buttons placed below it:

The idea that was based off the main menu was taken and helped inspire the gameplay section and instructions. As shown in the wireframes, the remaining designs follow the pattern of keeping the background dark while enhancing the vision of the characters, text and buttons. These wireframes are not the complete end result but only a vision of the future. The final sketches are complete on the End Appendixes

These themes have met the specification for the requirements of the design sector of the game. It keeps the dark theme along with the colour characters, which aim to attract the younger age group. Each section of the game was carefully considered when the designing phase was in session and when complete, the game was then followed through by designing the GUIs and buttons through coding. The design of the game was kept minimal but the gameplay and effective learning that was to come definitely made up for it.

# Chapter 8 - Prototype Evaluation &amp; Conclusion

In this section of the report, it will cover the entirety of the above chapters and help emphasise how the prototype game functions. The above chapters covered only certain parts of the project that are explicit for that cause. This chapter will help fill in the remaining features and techniques that were used to complete the prototype game. Maths Invaders was intended to be full of these features and actions to make it as interactive and purposeful as possible. Education can be a boring subject to partake but collaborating it with game-based learning produces many benefits. Maths Invaders has to benefit of contributing to the computer and simulation fluency which can be important because in today&#39;s age, we live in a world that is dominated by technology and computing. Allowing young children to get used to how the computers operates by playing the game and soon enough it becomes a second nature to them.

One key element Math Invaders develops is the hand-eye coordination of children. Whether they use a controller or a keyboard to operate the game. It can help the children coordinates the control of the eye with hand movement and process the visual input to guide the children with the fundamentals of maths and solving equations. This is because the children would have to look at the question on the screen whilst using their hands to control the character and shoot the target at the same time.

The project is structured to handle these points and make them fun to play. The behaviour of the game is another concern that was handled properly. One issue which was raised was how it would behave across different browsers and if it could handle the game equally. The game was designed with HTML 5 instead of Flash to help with multi-browser functionality. Unfortunately, the game does not work properly on Internet explorer because of the changing of web technologies and riddled with performance-lacking plug-ins. Google Chrome would be the best choice of play and it is one of the most common internet browsers among devices. Using this browser allows for the game to play in its fullest capacity which smooth running gameplay and clear graphics. The controls of the game all function as they should do and directing to each page works as it should.
